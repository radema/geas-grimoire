# Code Duplication Analysis Report

**Method:** Pylint duplicate-code check
**Configuration:** `min-similarity-lines=4`
**Scope:** `skills/` directory

## Summary
No code duplication was found in the repository. The codebase appears to be clean of copy-pasted blocks of 4 lines or more.

## Verification
To verify the detection tool, a temporary copy of `skills/build-knowledge/scripts/librarian.py` was created. Pylint successfully identified duplication between the original and the copy. The copy was then removed, and the final scan (below) shows zero duplicates.
